# Tweet Harvesting
This is part 4 of the Python portion of a Software Carpentry workshop that is built around some light handling of Twitter data.  There are four parts.  At the end of this section participants will be able to collect tweets for analysis using either a 100-tweet-at-a-time scraper or run a twitter stream scraper. Skills covered include:

* creating a twitter account
* Registering a project/app at https://apps.twitter.com/
* running a twitter scraper
* saving the results
